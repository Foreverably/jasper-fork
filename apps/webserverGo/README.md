# WebserverGo

This is a remake of the java-based webserver in Go.

## How to set it up

1. Copy `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`
2. Make the `JASPER_API_KEY` whatever you want
3. Fill between 1 and 3 of the `YOUTUBE_API_KEY_X`
4. Install the latest version of Go (or use Docker, skip to step 7)
5. `make build`
6. `make run`
7. If using Docker, `docker compose up`
8. Enjoy
