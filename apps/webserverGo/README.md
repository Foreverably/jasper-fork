# WebserverGo

This is a remake of the java-based webserver in Go.

## How to setup

You need Go 1.21+ installed in your system as well as the `chromium` command in your PATH (used for skullboard, ignore if u dont use it).

Then, just run `make build` and `make run`.

Alternatively, use Docker. It's already setup to have chromium
